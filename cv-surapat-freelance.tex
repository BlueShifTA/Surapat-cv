\cvsection{Consulting Profile}
Ex-CERN physicist and senior software/data engineer delivering high-impact technical consulting. I work with clients to capture requirements quickly, prototype fast, and harden solutions into production-grade systems across edge AI, data platforms, and full-stack applications.

\cvsection{Consulting Skills}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Client Delivery:} Requirement discovery, technical scoping, fast prototyping, production handover
    \item \textbf{Software \& Data:} Python, C/C++, TypeScript, FastAPI, Django, React/Next.js, data pipelines
    \item \textbf{ML \& Vision:} OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, sensor analytics
    \item \textbf{Edge \& Embedded:} Jetson TX2/Orin Nano, Linux, ROS2, real-time device-side analysis
    \item \textbf{Cloud \& Ops:} AWS (S3, EC2, SageMaker), Docker, GitLab CI, reproducible deployment workflows
    \item \textbf{Applied R\&D:} Optical sensing, noise reduction methods, CAD/mechanical prototyping support
\end{itemize}

\cvsection{Professional Experience}
\textbf{Lead Data Engineer / Data Scientist (Freelance, Remote)} \\
Altruistic Innovation Limited, UK \hfill 2021 -- 2022
\begin{itemize}
    \item Led client requirement discovery and converted business constraints into rapid prototypes for smart-grid monitoring.
    \item Originated and validated a method to reduce temperature-induced noise in optical edge sensors, improving signal reliability.
    \item Built ML/data pipelines and cloud architecture on AWS (SageMaker, S3, EC2) for scalable deployment.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Software Engineer} \\
Lino Biotech (Acquired by Miltenyi Biotec), Z\"urich \hfill 2023 -- Present
\begin{itemize}
    \item Delivered end-to-end product engineering across edge analytics, backend/frontend systems, and lab automation software.
    \item Achieved \textbf{10x speedup} in real-time molecular workflows and improved sensor sensitivity \textbf{5x} through pipeline redesign.
    \item Delivered core software for \textbf{1 prototype} and \textbf{2 product series launched to market}, while maintaining sensor software across \textbf{10+ client-side readers}.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Experimental Particle Physicist} \\
CERN (LHCb) / EPFL, Switzerland \hfill 2018 -- 2022
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reduced key systematic uncertainty by \textbf{4x} in high-precision data analysis pipelines.
    \item Co-authored analysis resulting in the first observation of neutral charm-meson mass difference (PRL 2021).
\end{itemize}

\cvsection{Selected Projects}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Robot-arm training workflow in Isaac Sim/Isaac Lab with ROS2; ongoing CAD and mechanical design development.
